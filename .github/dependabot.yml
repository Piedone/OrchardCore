  # Dependabot can handle at most 150 "manifests", so for NuGet, csprojs referencing packages (see docs:
  # https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/troubleshooting-the-dependency-graph#are-there-limits-which-affect-the-dependency-graph-data).
  # Grouping updates per directories to have smaller batches wouldn't work, because due to centralized package
  # management, the dependencies are not defined in the given projects, and thus Dependabot can't update them when
  # restricted to a directory (it won't know about Directory.packages.props). So, just processing Directory.packages.props.
